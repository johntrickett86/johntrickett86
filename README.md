I live in beautiful North Wales with my wife, two children and one knobhead dog. I've built a successful business from the ground up and am now diving into the tech world with a focus on digital strategies and bespoke software solutions.

Growing up I was fascinated by technology and how things worked. I love looking for the science in everything - but learning in a classroom environment never suited me. I needed to do things to understand them.

I started my career as an apprentice in the fire industry and went on to start and exit my own fire safety business. After working in the corporate world for a couple of years, I decided to combine my love of technology, coding and problem solving to help other businesses grow and achieve success.
