### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm John!

I love bringing business and technology together. I built and sold a fire safety business with technology at it's core.

I then went to work as Chief Information Officer for a large PE backed fire safety business, leading Digital Transformation, Application Development and Business Intelligence.

I love working with PHP and TALL Stack.

I'm currently working on an OpenSource project, developing a Laravel SDK for Simpro API.
